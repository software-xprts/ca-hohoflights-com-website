			 <h4> Why Frontier is considered the Greenest Airline? </h4>
			 <p> <strong> More Fuel Efficient Technology: </strong>  The largest A320neo fleet, operated by Frontier, has an average fleet age of four years. The carrier uses less fuel because the fleet is the youngest in the industry, which benefits both its clients and the environment by saving them money. </p>
			 
			 <p> <strong> Lean & Green Seats: </strong>  The amount of fuel an engine needs increases with the weight of the aircraft. Recaro seats that are more comfortable and lighter than previous models were introduced by Frontier in 2021 in order to reduce their environmental effect by 30%. </p>
			 
			 <p> <strong> Fly lighter: </strong>  Packing too much is so last year. To encourage travelers to bring less luggage, Frontier provide a range of travel options. Additionally, you may have noticed the lack of in-flight amenities like Wi-Fi and entertainment if you have previously travelled with the airline. These are conscious decisions it has done to decrease the load on the flights so that the earth can be happier. </p>
			 
			 <p> <strong> Inflight Changes: </strong> Frontier believes in implementing small changes that have a significant impact. Waste less.  Download the Frontier mobile app to access your boarding pass instead of printing it. Frontier Airlines is switching over to biodegradable cups from plastic ones now. It has also eliminated paper from the cockpit and stopped publishing a magazine.</p>
			 
			 <h4> You can make your trip even more greener </h4>
			 <ul>
			 <li> •	Reserve a green hotel or find a green accommodation on your trips </li>
			 <li> •	Use public transport such as buses or trains and take a bike or walk instead renting a car for personal use.</li>
			 <li> •	Give a boost to the local business and use less resource. </li>
			 <li> •	Reduce your luggage size. More baggage means more fuel consumption and larger carbonemission. </li>
			 <li> •	Bring a reliable water bottle to the airport and fill it up after you're passed security to reduce in-flight waste and the excessive use of plastic. </li>
			 </ul>
