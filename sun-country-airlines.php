             <h3> Sun Country Airlines </h3>
             <p> Sun Country Airlines is ranked eleventh in the United States in terms of passenger traffic. It is an American ultra-low-cost passenger and cargo airline with its headquarters at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Sun Country manages 86 travel routes between locations in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, with focal point city operations at McCarran International Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. For Amazon Air, Sun Country acts as a licensed cargo controller. </p>
			 <p> Sun Country Flights began operating commercial flights using a single Boeing 727-200 aircraft in January 1983. Sixteen pilots, sixteen aircraft attendants, three technicians, and one office worker made up the airline's inaugural crew. When Braniff International Airways went out of business on May 12, 1982, a number of the original employees worked there. The first President/CEO of the organization and founding member, Captain Jim Olsen, also held the position of Chief Pilot. His wife, Joan Smith-Olsen, worked as the chief flight attendant and director of inflight entertainment. In 1988, its headquarters were situatedat Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. The airline was acquired by Petters Group International and Whitebox Consultants in July 2006. </p>
			 <p> Following the resignation of temporary CEO Jay Salmen and the admission of a financial scam, Stan Gadek, a former CFO of AirTran Airways, was probably responsible for Sun Country's conclusion. The airline reduced its summer schedule and fired 45 of its 156 pilots as a result of rising fuel prices. Sun Country indicated that it expected receiving loans or other financial support from the state of Minnesota and the Minnesota Airports Committee totaling up to $50 million. </p>
